# CODEOWNERS - Require review from specific users for changes to protected files
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Workflow files require maintainer approval to prevent unauthorized deployment changes
# This protects against PRs that might try to:
# - Remove the environment declaration to bypass environment protection
# - Modify deployment conditions
# - Change security settings or permissions
